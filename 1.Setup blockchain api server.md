If we goto any blockchain explorer application, you can search any transaction or block info by inputting the given transaction or bloch hash, then the frontend will send the request to backend server, the later will use blockchain running
on its onw machine to query the given info then return the result to fontend page to show.

From this section, we will see how to build up such api server to enable users from frontend to query info about blockchain. And luckily we have setupt http server in previous section, now our job is how to combine our blockchain layer to 
serve any requests coming from frontend to the server. Let's pull up the server first, in cargo.toml we add the http server crate as following;

```rs
[dependencies]
actix-web = "4.1"
```

Then we create a new folder name apiserver, and create a new file inside it with name mod.rs, add the following code in the file:

```rs
use actix_web::{web, App, HttpResponse, HttpServer};
use serde::Deserialize;

pub struct ApiServer {
    port : u64,
}

impl ApiServer {
    pub fn new(port :u64) -> Self {
        return ApiServer{
            port,
        }
    }

    async fn get_index() -> HttpResponse {
        HttpResponse::Ok().body("Hello, world!")
    }


    pub async fn run(&self) {
        let server = HttpServer::new(||{
            App::new().route("/", web::get().to(Self::get_index))
        });
        println!("server run on port: {}", self.port);
        server.bind(("0.0.0.0", self.port))
        .unwrap().run()
        .await.expect("error running the server");
    }
}
```

Then let's goto run the server at main.rs as following:

```rs

pub mod apiserver;
use crate::apiserver::ApiServer;

#[actix_web::main]
async fn main() {
    let server = ApiServer::new(5000);
    server.run();
}
```

Run above code, make sure the server can pull up and test the server by using http://localhost:5000/ in browser, if everything gose ok, you should get result as following:
