In last section, we show how to send transaction info from frontend to backend, in this section, we will see how we can add the given transaction to blockchain then querying all added transactions from backend api. Let's see how can we change
the code to archive this.

Let's see the code changes in the mod.rs for apiserver:

```rs
//change here
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
use crate::blockchain::{BlockChain, 
    transaction::Transaction as BlockchainTransaction};
use crate::wallet::{Wallet, Transaction as WalletTransaction};
//change here
use std::{fmt::Debug, sync::{Arc, Mutex}};


#[derive(Serialize, Debug)]
pub struct TransactionsInBlockChain {
    transaction_count: usize,
    transactions: Vec<BlockchainTransaction>,
}

#[derive(Clone, Debug)]
pub struct ApiServer {
    port : u64,
    //change here, since we will change HashMap
    /*
    Using Arc here will prevent cloning of Mutext which is not allowed
    Since we need to clone the ApiServer instance at least once at
    run(), therefore we need to use Arc to wrap the Mutex
    */
    cache: Arc<Mutex<HashMap<String, BlockChain>>>,
}
```

Let's check about the above changes. First we define a new struct named TransactionsInBlockChain, this struct will used to get transactions in the blockchain transaction pool and send back to frontend. The BlockchainTransaction is actually
the Transaction struct defined in blockchain crate. We make some important changes to the definition of ApiServer, since we need to change the state of blockchain object in the hash map, and the ApiServer object is shared by many worker 
threads of actix_web, then we need an Mutex to prevent read-write confliction, that's why we wrap the HashMap object inside the Mutex Object.

One problem for Mutex object is that, it is not clonable, if it is, it will break the read-write guarding of the hash map object. But In the run method of the ApiServer, it needs to clone the ApiServer object at lease once, this will again
the no-clonable rule of mutex. In order to solve this confliction, we use Arc to wrap then again. When we going to clone the ApiSerer Object, The mutex will not be cloned, instead their is a counter attach to the Mutex, each time there is 
a clone request for the mutex, the code only increase the referencing counter and the mutex object still remain in one copy.

Another change is in the new function of ApiServer :

```rs
 pub fn new(port :u64) -> Self {
        //changed here
        let cache = Arc::new(Mutex::new(HashMap::new()));
        let  api_server = ApiServer{
            port,
            cache,
        };
        let wallet_miner = Wallet::new();
        //change here
        {
            //here create the borrowing effect of api_server , we need to make the lock out of scope
            //to make the mutex unlock, then remove the borrowing of api_server then api_server can be return
            let mut unlock_cache = api_server.cache.lock().unwrap();
            unlock_cache.insert("blockchain".to_string(), BlockChain::new(wallet_miner.get_address()));
        }
        return api_server;
    }
```

Since we wrap the hash map object using Mutex then wrapping mutex by using arc, therefore we need to create the instance of hash map by creating mutex and arc object first. And there is one tricky thing. When we need to insert a BlockChain 
object into the hash map, and since the map is alread guard against by the mutex, we need to gain the lock first and then we can go to write into the map. We call the lock method of Mutex, if we require the lock successfully, then it will
return a Result object which is wrapping the hash map object inside it, we need to use the unwrap to take the hash map object inside the Result object out.

But calling the lock method of mutex will cause the referencing the Mutex object, which cause the ApiServer object to be referenced. The unrefernce of mutex need it to be unlocked. But there is not unlock method for Mutex object. The only way
to unlock a mutex object is the code run out of its scope, that's why we are using Braces to wrap the code, when the code reach the right brace, the mutex will unlock itself, then deferencing the mutex which causes the dereferencing the 
ApiServer object and then we can return the api_server object from the function.

Then the next change will be the get_transaction_handler function:

```rs
pub async fn get_transaction_handler(data: web::Data<Arc<ApiServer>>
        ,transaction: web::Json<Transaction>) -> HttpResponse {
        //change here
        let tx = transaction.into_inner();
        debug!("receive json info: {:?}", tx);
        //convert amount from string to f64
        let amount = tx.amount.parse::<f64>().unwrap();
        //amount is of type Result<f64,...>
        let wallet = Wallet::new_from(&tx.public_key, &tx.private_key, &tx.blockchain_address);
        let wallet_tx = wallet.sign_transaction(&tx.recipient_address, amount);
        let api_server = data.get_ref();
        //we don't need to unlock, the mutex will unlock as long as go out of scope
        let mut unlock_cache = api_server.cache.lock().unwrap();
        let  block_chain = unlock_cache.get_mut("blockchain").unwrap();
        let add_result = block_chain.add_transaction(&wallet_tx);
        if !add_result {
            info!("add transaction to blockchain fail");
            return HttpResponse::InternalServerError().json("add transaction to blockchain fail");
        }
        info!("add transaction to blockchain ok");
        return HttpResponse::Ok().json("add transaction to blocktrain ok");
    }
```

Since the fields in the json object that is passed to the above handler are all string, especially the amount field is in string format, we need to convert it to floating data first. Since the json object passed here contains the 
public key, private key and the sender address, we need to construct the wallet object from these information, that's why we add a new function for Wallet struct, we will see this function in later. We still need to pay attention to
how we access to the blockchain object. We first need to call the lock of Mutex to gain the write access, then using the get_mut method of hash map to get a mutable reference to the blockchain object, since we need to change the state
of the block chain by adding a new transaction.

We use the wallet object to sign the transaction and getting back the signed transaction object and call the add_transaction method of blockchain to add it to the transaction pool. Then let's see another new change that is we add a new
handler to get all transactions from the transaction pool of the blockchain object:

```rs
pub async fn show_transactions(data: web::Data<Arc<ApiServer>>) -> HttpResponse {
        let api_server = data.get_ref();
        let mut unlock_cache = api_server.cache.lock().unwrap();
        let  block_chain = unlock_cache.get("blockchain").unwrap();
        let mut get_transactions = TransactionsInBlockChain{
            transaction_count: 0,
            transactions: Vec::<BlockchainTransaction>::new(),
        };
        get_transactions.transactions = block_chain.get_transactions();
        get_transactions.transaction_count = get_transactions.transactions.len();
        
        debug!("show transactions in chain: {:?}", get_transactions);
        HttpResponse::Ok().json(get_transactions)
    }
```
In above function, we get the blockchain object from the ApiServer instance and initialize a TransactionsInBlockChain object, setting its transaction counter to 0, and initialize a new empty transaction list. Then we call the 
get_transactions method from blockchain object which will return a list of blockchain transaction objects, we will see its code in latter section, then we set the list into the TransactionsInBlockChain object and serialize it to a 
json object and returns back to the frontend.

Let's see the next change in the api server code, since we add a new handler function to show all transactions in the blockchain ,then we will add a endpoint for the handler:

```rs
pub async fn run(&self) {
    let api = Arc::new(self.clone());
    HttpServer::new(move || {
        App::new()
        .app_data(web::Data::new(api.clone()))
        .wrap(actix_web::middleware::Logger::default())
        .route("/", web::get().to(Self::get_index_handler))
        .route("/wallet", web::get().to(Self::get_wallet))
        .route("/get_wallet", web::get().to(Self::get_wallet_handler))
        .route("/transaction", web::post().to(Self::get_transaction_handler))
        //change here
        .route("/show_transactions", web::get().to(Self::show_transactions))
        });
    ....
}
```

That's all for the changes in the mod.rs for apiserver crates. Let's see the changes in the wallet crates, first we need to change the amount field in Transaction from u64 to f64 since we need to support floating value:

```rs
#[derive(Serialize, Debug, Clone)]
//changed here
pub struct Transaction {
    pub sender: String,
    pub recipient: String,
    pub amount: f64,
    pub public_key: String,
    pub signature: String,
}
```

Then we need to add the new_from method to generate a wallet instance from strings of public key , private key and sender address:

```rs
pub fn new_from(public_key_str: &String, private_key_str: &String, 
        address: &String) -> Self {
            let mut public_key_bin = hex::decode(public_key_str).unwrap();
            /*
            sec1 format is 0x04 || x coordinate of publick key || y coordinate of public key
            */
            public_key_bin.insert(0, 0x04);
            let verifying_key = VerifyingKey::from_sec1_bytes(&public_key_bin).unwrap();

            let private_key_bytes = hex::decode(&private_key_str).expect("Invalid private key hex string");
            //the binary data of private key need to be 32 bytes,
            //private_key_bytes is type of Vec<u8>, the try_into convert it to [u8;32] fix length slice
            //and from_bytes need type of GenericArray, then we used into of slice to convert it
            let private_key_bytes: [u8; 32] = private_key_bytes.try_into().expect("invalid private key length");          
            let signing_key = SigningKey::from_bytes((&private_key_bytes).into()).unwrap();

            Wallet {
                verifying_key,
                signing_key, 
                address: address.clone(),
            }
    }
```

We have already seen how to generate SigningKey and VerifyingKey hex string before, and we move those code into the new_from function and create the SigningKey and VerifyingKey object from given hex data string, then we can construct
the wallet object out from the three given string. Now we need to change the input parameter of amount for sign_transaction from u64 to f64:

```rs
pub fn sign_transaction(&self, receiver: &String, amount: f64) -> Transaction {
    ....
}
```

That's all for the changes in wallet crates, let's see changes in blockchain crates:

```rs
  //change here 
    pub fn get_transactions(&self) -> Vec<Transaction> {
        let mut transactions = Vec::<Transaction>::new();
        for tx_in_pool in self.transaction_pool.iter() {
            transactions.push(Transaction::deserialization(tx_in_pool.to_vec()));
        }

        transactions
    }
```
We add a new method with name get_transactions for the BlockChain object, it just get all binary transaction data from the transaction pool and deserialize them into Transaction object, then push then to the vector and return the vector.
We go to modify the add_transaction function a little bit, just comment out the balance checking:

```rs
pub fn add_transaction(&mut self, tx: &WalletTransaction) -> bool{
    ...
    //make sure sender has enough balance
        //change here
        // if self.calculate_total_amount(tx.sender.clone()) < tx.amount as i64 {
        //     println!("sender does not have enough balance");
        //     return false;
        // }
     ...
}
```

That's all changes in the mod.rs of Blockchain crate, let's check the changes in transactions.rs:

```rs
//change here
use serde::{Serialize, Deserialize};
use serde_json;
#[derive(Debug, Serialize)]
//change here
pub struct Transaction {
    pub sender_address: Vec<u8>,
    pub recipient_address: Vec<u8>,
    pub value: f64,
}
```

We need to make the Transaction object can be serialize into json object, and change the type of field value from u64 to f64, and we need to change the input parameter of value for new method from u64 to f64:

```rs
 //change here
    pub fn new(sender: Vec<u8>, recipient: Vec<u8>, value: f64) -> Transaction {
        Transaction {
            sender_address: sender,
            recipient_address: recipient,
            value,
        }
    }
```
That's all for the changes, now start up the program, get the wallet info by using http://localhost:5000/wallet as following:

Then you can change the recipient address and amount many times and click send, which means you are creating many transactions. Then using link http://localhost:5000/show_transactions to get all transactions in the pool as following:

<img width="1347" alt="截屏2024-11-23 17 20 41" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65db7798-8e71-4c32-9baa-be0c8f6d3b97">

As you can see from above image, I have added two transactions into the pool.
